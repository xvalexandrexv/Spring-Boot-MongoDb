# User Posting App

A user posting application built with Spring Boot, MongoDB, and a RESTful API for the back end, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. This project allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts,
providing back-end service for managing user-generated content with a user-friendly interface, while the front end currently provides a static interface showing only the users created at database.
